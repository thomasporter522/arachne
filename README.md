### The constrained Latin sentence generator.

Beginning students of Latin practice their language skills by translating Latin sentences into English. As an
alternative to the labor intensive process of manually creating sentences, while still accounting for the studentsâ€™
levels of skill, a constrained Latin sentence generator is developed. A dependency model is used, in which a
sentence is modelled as a totally ordered rooted tree with words as vertices and dependency relationships as
edges. The set of allowed words is the constrained vocabulary, and the set of allowed dependency relationships
is the constrained grammar. The inflection of words is constrained by the grammar and the user, and is otherwise
random. A fully customizable, grammatical Latin sentence generator is achieved, with the ability to expand
vocabulary and grammar for classroom use.
