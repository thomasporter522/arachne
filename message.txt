Arachne generates Latin sentences according to your selected vocabulary terms, grammar constructs, 
and verb endings. Select the items you want to appear in the sentences, choose a number of sentences to generate and a 
length limiation, and click "Go." 
- Your selections will be overridden if a grammar item or vocabulary word demands something you have not selected. If no verb 
endings you have selected are compatible with the grammar in a certain instance, an appropriate ending will be selected randomly.
- The length limitation imposes a rough limit on how elaborate the sentence can be.
